/**
 * The general Nebular component-container.
 * It is required that all children component of the framework are located inside of the nb-layout.
 *
 * Can contain the following components inside:
 *
 * ```
 * nb-layout-header
 * nb-layout-column
 * nb-sidebar
 * nb-layout-footer
 * ```
 *
 * By default the layout fills up the full view-port.
 * The window scrollbars are disabled on the body and moved inside of the nb-layout, so that the scrollbars
 * won't mess with the fixed nb-header.
 *
 * The children components are projected into the flexible layout structure allowing to adjust the layout behavior
 * based on the settings provided.
 *
 * The layout content (columns) becomes centered when the window width is more than
 * the value specified in the theme variable `layout-content-width`.
 *
 * The layout also contains the area on the very top (the first child of the nb-layout), which could be used
 * to dynamically append some components like modals or spinners/loaders
 * so that they are located on top of the elements hierarchy.
 * More details are below under the `ThemeService` section.
 *
 * The layout component is also responsible for changing of the application themes.
 * It listens to the `themeChange` event and change the theme CSS class appended to body.
 * Based on the class appended a specific CSS-theme is applied to the application.
 * More details of the Theme System could be found here [Enabling Theme System](#/docs/concepts/theme-system)
 *
 * @example A simple layout example:
 *
 * ```
 * <nb-layout>
 *   <nb-layout-header>Great Company</nb-layout-header>
 *
 *   <nb-layout-column>
 *     Hello World!
 *   </nb-layout-column>
 *
 *   <nb-layout-footer>Contact us</nb-layout-footer>
 * </nb-layout>
 * ```
 *
 * @example For example, it is possible to ask the layout to center the columns (notice: we added a `center` attribute
 * to the layout:
 *
 * ```
 * <nb-layout center>
 *   <nb-layout-header>Great Company</nb-layout-header>
 *
 *   <nb-layout-column>
 *     Hello World!
 *   </nb-layout-column>
 *
 *   <nb-layout-footer>Contact us</nb-layout-footer>
 * </nb-layout>

 * layout-font-family
 * layout-font-size
 * layout-line-height
 * layout-fg
 * layout-bg
 * layout-min-height
 * layout-content-width
 * layout-window-mode-min-width
 * layout-window-mode-max-width: window mode only, after this value layout turns into floating window
 * layout-window-mode-bg: window mode only, background
 * layout-window-mode-padding-top: window mode only, max padding from top
